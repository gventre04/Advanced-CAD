## Gears

### Objective

In this assignmnet I made 4 different configurations of a gear in solidworks utilizing equations to create the individual gears with ease, rather than starting each individual gear from scratch. This assignment is designed to ultimately create a gearbox in which the gears mesh perfectly and function just as well.

### Lesson(s) Learned

The terminology involved with the gears is definitely something that will take a while to completely understand and use in the future. In all, the solidworks wasn't too difficult, I struggled a bit to make the cut for the teeth of the gear, it's good to make sure that all the lines are fixed (black rather than blue) before making the cuts for the teeth, the rest was prior knowledge regarding configurations and such. It is also good to remember using equals signs before using/writing an equation in smart dimension.

## Gearbox

### Objective

Using the gears made in the previous assignment as well as several other parts (axle, spacer, knob, and a plate), I made several sub assemblies which I then made into one final assembly, the gearbox.

### Lesson(s) Learned

The hardest part was definitely the plate on which the gear assemblies would be placed. What made it particularly difficult was the lack of instruction provided with which to complete the part. I found it useful to estimate the size of the windows as you won't be able to completely know them until you start making the gearbox assembly, remembering to also use trim entities to create your window cutouts. I also found some difficulty using gear mates to make the gears mesh perfectly, I looked up a video on this, but never completely solved this problem, I made it better, but not a complete mesh unfortunately.
